GitHub, as detailed on Wikipedia, is a web-based hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, and Scott Chacon, building upon the Git version control system. The name itself is a combination of "Git" and "hub," reflecting its role as a central platform for Git repositories. 
Key aspects of GitHub include:
Version Control:
It utilizes Git, a distributed version control system, allowing developers to track changes in their code, collaborate effectively, and revert to previous versions if needed.
Collaboration:
GitHub facilitates collaboration among developers by providing tools for code sharing, pull requests (for proposing changes and merging them), issue tracking, and discussions.
Project Hosting:
It serves as a platform to host software projects, making them accessible to a global community of developers.
Community and Ecosystem:
GitHub has grown into a vast ecosystem with millions of users and projects, fostering open-source development and providing resources like wikis, GitHub Pages for website hosting, and GitHub Gist for sharing code snippets.
Features:
Beyond core version control, GitHub offers a range of features including wikis for project documentation, issue tracking, project management tools, and integrations with various third-party services.
